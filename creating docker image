Download atlan.py & Dockerfile.env
Open powershell/command line in administrator mode.
set path to the folder where the step-1 files are placed.
Now run the following code.
docker build -f Dockerfile.env -t my_new_image:1.0 .
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -it -p 5000:5000 my_new_image:1.0
Now your docker image is build and running at port 5000.
To share your image you can push your image on dockerhub and change it's privacy to public.
Here is my dockerhub public link for the API :- https://hub.docker.com/r/bittuboss601/atlan
Happy Coding :)
